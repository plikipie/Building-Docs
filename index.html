            <p><strong>What is WEB3?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Web3, also known as Web 3.0, is the next iteration of the
              internet. It's a vision of a decentralized internet where users
              have more control over their data and digital assets.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key features of Web3:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Decentralization: </strong>This is the core principle
                  of Web3. Instead of relying on centralized servers, Web3 uses
                  <code>blockchain</code> technology to distribute data across a
                  network of computers. This makes it more resistant to
                  censorship and single points of failure.

                  ><code>Blockchain</code> is a distributed ledger system that
                  records transactions across multiple computers. It ensures
                  transparency, security, and immutability of data. (<code

                  <strong>Cryptocurrencies: </strong>Cryptocurrencies like
                  Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital currencies that operate on
                  blockchain technology. They enable peer-to-peer transactions
                  without the need for intermediaries.

                  self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement
                  directly written into code. They automate processes and reduce
                  the need for intermediaries.

                  digital assets that can represent anything from art and music
                  to real-world objects. They are stored on
                  <code>blockchains</code> and can be bought, sold, or traded.

            <p><strong>What Is Blockhain?</strong></p>
            <p>
              A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records
              transactions across multiple computers. It ensures transparency,
              security, and immutability of data. 1 Think of it as a digital
              ledger that is shared across a network of computers.
            </p>
            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Transactions: </strong>When a transaction occurs
                  (e.g., sending money or transferring ownership of a digital
                  asset), it is broadcasted to the network.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Block Creation: </strong>These transactions are
                  grouped together into blocks.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Block Verification: </strong>The network of computers
                  verifies the transactions in each block.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Block Addition: </strong>Once verified, the block is
                  added to the chain, creating a permanent record.

              A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of
              the agreement directly written into code. It operates on a
              blockchain 1 network, automating processes and reducing the need
              for intermediaries.   1

            <p><strong>How do Smart Contracts work?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Code Implementation: </strong>A smart contract is
                  written in a programming language like Solidity, which is then
                  deployed onto a blockchain.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Triggering Events: </strong>Specific events, such as a
                  certain date or the fulfillment of a condition, trigger the
                  execution of the contract.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Automatic Execution: </strong>The blockchain network
                  automatically executes the terms of the contract, ensuring
                  that the agreement is fulfilled without human intervention.

              Web3 development involves creating decentralized applications
              (dApps) that leverage blockchain technology. These dApps operate
              on a decentralized network, eliminating the need for
              intermediaries and empowering users.
